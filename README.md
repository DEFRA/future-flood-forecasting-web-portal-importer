# Future Flood Forecasting Web Portal Importer

Node.js Microsoft Azure functions responsible for extracting data from the core forecasting engine and importing it into a staging database prior to transformation for reporting and visualisation purposes.

* Queue based triggering is used when:
  * Importing data for a single location during the previous twenty fours hours.
  * Importing data for multiple locations associated with a display group
  * Refreshing the set of locations associated with each display group.

## Prerequisites

### Mandatory

* Microsoft Azure resource group
* Microsoft Azure storage account
* Microsoft Azure storage queue named **fewspiqueue**
* Microsoft Azure storage queue named **fews-location-lookup-queue**
* Microsoft Azure service bus
* Microsoft Azure service bus queue named **fews-eventcode-queue**
* Microsoft Azure service bus topic named **fews-eventcode-topic**
* **Node.js** Microsoft Azure function app with an **application service plan**
* Microsoft Azure SQL database configured using the [Future Flood Forecasting Web Portal Staging](https://github.com/DEFRA/future-flood-forecasting-web-portal-staging) project.
  * The function app must have connectivity to the Azure SQL database either through the use of a Microsoft Azure virtual network or
    appropriate firewall rules.
* A UNIX based operating system with bash and the nc utility installed is required to run unit tests.
  * If using Microsoft Windows, you may wish to consider using the [Windows Subsystem For Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).

## Unit Testing Considerations

As this Azure function app is responsible for placing data extracted from the core forecasting engine into an Azure SQL database, unit tests
need to check that the database is populated correctly. As such, rather than mocking database functionality, a dedicated database instance is required for unit testing purposes. This dedicated database instance must be created in the same way as non-unit test specific instances using the [Future Flood Forecasting Web Portal Staging](https://github.com/DEFRA/future-flood-forecasting-web-portal-staging) project. Unit test specific environment variables (defined below) must be set to allow the unit tests to utilise a dedicated database instance.

* If unit test specific environment variables identify an existing database instance, the instance will be used by unit tests.
* If unit test specific environment variables do not identify an existing database instance a docker based Microsoft SQL Server instance will be
  created for use by the unit tests.
  * The creation of docker based Microsoft SQL Server instances relies on the prerequisites of the [Future Flood Forecasting Web Portal Staging](https://github.com/DEFRA/future-flood-forecasting-web-portal-staging) project.

## Installation Activities

The following activities need to be performed for the function to run. While the documentation states what activities need to be performed it
does not prescribe how the activities should be performed.

* Configure app settings/environment variables
* Install node modules
* Install function extensions
* Deploy the functions to the function app

## Running The Queue Based Functions

* Messages placed on the fewspiqueue **must** contain only the ID of the location for which data is to be imported.
* Messages placed on the fews-location-lookup-queue **must** contain some content; for example {"input": "refresh"}.
  The message content is ignored.
* Messages placed on the fews-eventcode-queue or fews-eventcode-topic **must** adhere to the format used for
  Azure service bus alerts in the core forecasting engine.
