# Future Flood Forecasting Web Portal Importer

Node.js Microsoft Azure functions responsible for extracting data from the core forecasting engine and importing it into a staging database prior to transformation for reporting and visualisation purposes.

* Message based triggering is used when:
  * Importing multivariate threshold data
  * Importing data for frequently updated locations that are not associated with a core forecasting engine display group.
  * Importing data for multiple locations associated with a core forecasting engine fluvial display group.
  * Importing data for multiple locations associated with a core forecasting engine coastal display group.
  * Refreshing the list of fluvial forecast locations.
  * Refreshing the list of coastal forecast locations. One message trigger for each of the three coastal location types.
  * Refreshing the set of fluvial locations associated with each core forecasting engine display group.
  * Refreshing the set of coastal locations associated with each core forecasting engine display group.
  * Refreshing the set of core forecasting engine filters associated with each workflow.
  * Refreshing the set of core forecasting engine ignored workflows.
* Messages containing the primary keys of staging database records holding data extracted from the core forecasting engine
  are used to trigger reporting and visualisation activities.
* CRON expression based triggering is used to periodically remove stale timeseries data from the staging database.
